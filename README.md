# Power-BI-Project

This project focuses on transforming raw data into professional-quality reports and dashboards for AdventureWorks
Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company. The project follows key stages of the business intelligence workflow:
connecting and shaping data with Power Query, building a relational data model, creating calculated fields using DAX,
and visualizing data through reports and dashboards. Each stage emphasizes practical tools and techniques used in
real-world data analysis, including data preparation, modeling, and visualization best practices.
