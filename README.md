# Power-BI-Project

In this project, I'm working on transforming raw data into professional-quality reports and dashboards for AdventureWorks Cycles, 
a fictional manufacturing company. The process follows the key stages of a typical business intelligence workflow. It starts with 
connecting and shaping the data using Power Query, followed by building a relational data model, and then creating calculated fields with DAX. 
Finally, I bring everything together through data visualization in reports and dashboards. Each step focuses on practical, 
real-world tools and techniques, covering data preparation, modeling, and visualization best practices.
